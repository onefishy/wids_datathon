<b>What I Do:</b> I’m a Research Associate at the Institute for Computational Sciences at Harvard University.<br><br>
I’m a machine learning researcher focusing on health care applications. I work with clinicians to build machine learning models that have desirable properties for specific real-life downstream tasks. The model properties that I often concentrate on are: human interpretability and useful predictive uncertainties.<br><br>
<b>What I Love About Data Science:</b>I love that recent developments in data science is beginning to allow us to combine insights from data and domain knowledge from human experts in meaningful ways!<br><br>
<b>What Else:</b>I’ve been organizing this workshop since 2017 and I am thrilled to be doing it again this year!
